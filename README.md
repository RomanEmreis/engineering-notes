# Engineering Notes

This repository contains design explorations, architectural notes and technical experiments.

The goal is not to document finished solutions — but to explore tradeoffs, system design decisions and emerging patterns in modern infrastructure.

## Focus Areas

- distributed system architecture
- composable middleware design
- async runtime ergonomics
- HTTP abstraction layers
- identity-first system design
- AI agent infrastructure

## Why this exists

Engineering complexity often grows from implicit assumptions and hidden abstractions.

These notes explore:

- making systems explicit
- reducing cognitive load without removing power
- balancing developer experience with performance constraints
  
## Structure

Notes are informal and evolving.

They may include:

- design experiments
- architecture sketches
- tradeoff analysis
- conceptual explorations

## Status

Work in progress.
Some notes may be incomplete or exploratory by nature.
